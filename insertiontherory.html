    <h1>Insertion Sort Algorithm</h1>

    <p>
      In this article, we will discuss the Insertion Sort Algorithm. Insertion
      sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one
      item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more
      advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort, but it can
      be useful for small datasets or as part of more complex sorting
      algorithms.

    <h1>Algorithm</h1>
    <pre>
        Complexity does not matter
        Simple and short code is preferred
        Algorithm
        In the algorithm given below, suppose arr is an array of n elements. The insertion sort algorithm will sort the given array in-place.

        begin InsertionSort(arr)  
           for i from 1 to n-1
               key = arr[i]
               j = i - 1
               while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key
                   arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
                   j = j - 1
               end while
               arr[j + 1] = key
           end for     
           return arr     
        end InsertionSort

    <h1>Working of Insertion Sort Algorithm</h1>
    <pre>
 
        Now, let's see the working of the Insertion Sort Algorithm.

        To understand the working of the insertion sort algorithm, let's take an unsorted array. We will go through the step-by-step process of sorting the array using insertion sort.

        [Insertion Sort Steps Here]
        Insertion Sort is an intuitive sorting algorithm that operates on the principle of building a sorted portion of an array while iterating through its unsorted part. Here's a more detailed breakdown of its step-by-step execution:

        Initialization: Start with the second element (index 1) of the array, assuming that the first element (index 0) is already sorted.
        
        Iterative Process: For each unsorted element in the array, perform the following steps:
        
        Select the Key: Take the current unsorted element as the "key" that needs to be inserted into its correct position in the sorted portion.
        Comparison and Shifting: Compare the key with the elements in the sorted part of the array, moving from right to left.
        While the key is smaller than the elements being compared, shift those elements one position to the right to make space for the key.
        Insertion: When you find the correct position for the key (i.e., when the key is not smaller than the element on its left), insert it there.
        Repeat: Continue this process for each unsorted element in the array until the entire array is sorted.
        
        End: The array is now fully sorted, with all elements in their correct order.
        
        Illustration with an Example:
        
        Let's illustrate the Insertion Sort algorithm with a concrete example using the array [5, 2, 9, 3, 6].
        
        Step 1: Initial Array: [5, 2, 9, 3, 6] (Element 5 is assumed to be in the sorted portion initially).
        
        Step 2: Iteration 1
        
        Key = 2
        Compare 2 with 5 (the sorted part).
        2 < 5, so shift 5 to the right.
        Updated array: [2, 5, 9, 3, 6]
        Step 3: Iteration 2
        
        Key = 9
        Compare 9 with 5.
        9 > 5, so the key stays in its current position.
        Array remains the same.
        Step 4: Iteration 3
        
        Key = 3
        Compare 3 with 9 and then with 5.
        3 < 9, so shift 9 to the right.
        Compare 3 with 5.
        3 < 5, so shift 5 to the right.
        Insert 3 in its correct position.
        Updated array: [2, 3, 5, 9, 6]
        Step 5: Iteration 4
        
        Key = 6
        Compare 6 with 9.
        6 < 9, so shift 9 to the right.
        Compare 6 with 5.
        6 > 5, so the key stays in its current position.
        Array remains the same.
        Step 6: Final Array (Fully Sorted): [2, 3, 5, 6, 9]
        
        This detailed breakdown illustrates how Insertion Sort systematically moves through the array, inserting each element into its appropriate position within the sorted part, resulting in a fully sorted array.
        
        Insertion Sort's simplicity and efficiency for small datasets make it a valuable sorting technique in various situations, especially when you're dealing with partially sorted data. However, its time complexity of O(n^2) makes it less suitable for large datasets compared to more efficient algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort.ort.
