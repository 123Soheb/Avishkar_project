    <h1>Cocktail Sort Algorithm</h1>

    <p>
      In this article, we will discuss the Cocktail Sort Algorithm, also known
      as Bidirectional Bubble Sort. Cocktail Sort is a variation of the Bubble
      Sort algorithm that works by sorting elements in both directions, from the
      beginning to the end and then from the end to the beginning. It is less
      efficient than some other sorting algorithms but provides insights into
      sorting techniques.

        Simple sorting is needed for small datasets.
        There is a desire to explore different sorting algorithms.
        Algorithm
        Cocktail Sort is a variation of the Bubble Sort algorithm. It sorts elements by repeatedly stepping through the list in both directions, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. Here's a high-level summary of the algorithm:

        1. **Forward Pass**: Start by sorting the elements from the beginning of the list to the end, similar to the Bubble Sort. In this pass, larger elements "bubble" to the end of the list.

        2. **Backward Pass**: After completing the forward pass, switch to a backward pass. Start from the end of the list and move towards the beginning. In this pass, smaller elements "sink" towards the beginning of the list.

        3. **Repeat**: Continue alternating between forward and backward passes until no more swaps are made in a complete pass. This indicates that the list is fully sorted.

        begin CocktailSort(arr)  
           swapped = true
           start = 0
           end = length of arr - 1

           while swapped
               swapped = false

               // Forward pass
               for i from start to end
                   if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]
                       swap arr[i] and arr[i + 1]
                       swapped = true
                   end if
               end for

               // If no swaps in forward pass, the list is sorted
               if not swapped
                   break

               swapped = false
               end = end - 1  // Decrease the end for backward pass

               // Backward pass
               for i from end - 1 down to start
                   if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]
                       swap arr[i] and arr[i + 1]
                       swapped = true
                   end if
               end for

               start = start + 1  // Increase the start for the next forward pass
           end while

           return arr     
        end CocktailSort

    <h1>Working of Cocktail Sort Algorithm</h1>
    <pre>
 
        Cocktail Sort, also known as Bidirectional Bubble Sort, is a sorting algorithm that iterates through the list in both directions, repeatedly comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:

        1. **Forward Pass**: The algorithm begins by sorting the elements from the beginning of the list to the end, similar to the Bubble Sort. In this pass, larger elements "bubble" to the end of the list. Swaps are made whenever adjacent elements are out of order.

        2. **Backward Pass**: After completing the forward pass, the algorithm switches to a backward pass. It starts from the end of the list and moves towards the beginning. In this pass, smaller elements "sink" towards the beginning of the list. Again, swaps are made if necessary.

        3. **Repeat**: The algorithm alternates between forward and backward passes until no more swaps are made in a complete pass. If no swaps occur in a pass, it indicates that the list is fully sorted, and the algorithm terminates.

        Cocktail Sort's bidirectional approach can sometimes be more efficient than the traditional Bubble Sort, as it can reduce the number of passes required to fully sort the list. However, it is still less efficient than many other sorting algorithms and is primarily used for educational purposes.
