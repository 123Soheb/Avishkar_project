    <h1>Pigeonhole Sort Algorithm</h1>

    <p>
      Pigeonhole Sort is a sorting algorithm that is suitable for sorting
      elements within a specific range of integers. It uses the concept of
      "pigeonholes" to sort the elements efficiently. While it's not commonly
      used for large datasets, it's an interesting sorting technique to explore.

    <p><span>Pigeonhole Sort is preferred in scenarios where:</span></p>
    <li>
      The range of values is not significantly larger than the number of
      elements.
    </li>
    <li>Optimal space complexity is not a primary concern.</li>

        The range of values is not significantly larger than the number of elements.
        Optimal space complexity is not a primary concern.
        Algorithm
        Pigeonhole Sort is a sorting algorithm that is particularly useful when you have a limited range of values to sort. Here's how it works:

        1. **Find the Minimum and Maximum Values**: First, determine the minimum and maximum values in the input array. This information is crucial for defining the range of values.

        2. **Create Pigeonholes**: Create an array of pigeonholes, where each pigeonhole represents a possible value within the range of the input elements.

        3. **Distribute Elements into Pigeonholes**: Iterate through the input array, placing each element into its corresponding pigeonhole based on its value. Elements with the same value can be placed in the same pigeonhole.

        4. **Collect Sorted Elements**: After distributing all elements into the pigeonholes, go through the pigeonholes in order, and for each non-empty pigeonhole, copy its elements back into the original input array in the order they appear.

        That's the essence of Pigeonhole Sort. It's efficient when the range of values is not significantly larger than the number of elements, but it's not suitable for large ranges.

    <h1>Working of Pigeonhole Sort</h1>
    <pre>
 
        Pigeonhole Sort is an algorithm best suited for sorting elements within a limited range of values. Here's how it works in more detail:

        1. **Find the Minimum and Maximum Values**: The first step is to identify the minimum and maximum values in the input array. This step helps determine the range of values to be sorted.

        2. **Create Pigeonholes**: Next, create an array of pigeonholes. Each pigeonhole represents a possible value within the range. Essentially, you're preparing slots for each possible value.

        3. **Distribute Elements into Pigeonholes**: Iterate through the input array and, for each element, place it into the corresponding pigeonhole based on its value. If multiple elements share the same value, they will be placed in the same pigeonhole.

        4. **Collect Sorted Elements**: After all elements have been placed in the pigeonholes, iterate through the pigeonholes in order, from the minimum value to the maximum value. For each non-empty pigeonhole, copy its elements back into the original input array in the order they appear.

        Pigeonhole Sort's efficiency shines when the range of values is not significantly larger than the number of elements. For large ranges, this sorting algorithm may not be the most efficient choice.
