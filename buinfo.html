    <h1>Bubble Sort Algorithm</h1>

    <p>
      In this article, we will discuss the Bubble Sort Algorithm. Bubble Sort is
      a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping
      adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. Understanding Bubble
      Sort is fundamental for anyone learning about sorting algorithms.

        Simplicity and ease of implementation are prioritized over performance.
        It's used as an educational tool to teach the concept of sorting algorithms.
        Algorithm
        Bubble Sort gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the array in each pass. The algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:

        1. **Iterate Through the Array**: Start by comparing the first two elements of the array. If the first element is larger than the second, swap them.

        2. **Continue Swapping**: Continue this process for each adjacent pair of elements in the array, moving from left to right. After the first pass, the largest element will have "bubbled up" to the last position.

        3. **Repeat**: Repeat the above steps for the remaining unsorted portion of the array. In each pass, the next largest element will be in its correct position.

        4. **Complete Passes**: Keep repeating the process until no more swaps are needed in a pass. At this point, the entire array is sorted.

        begin BubbleSort(arr)  
           n = length of arr
           swapped = false
           do
               swapped = false
               for i from 0 to n-2
                   if arr[i] > arr[i+1]
                       swap(arr[i], arr[i+1])
                       swapped = true
                   end if
               end for
               n = n - 1
           while swapped
           return arr     
        end BubbleSort

    <h1>Working of Bubble Sort Algorithm</h1>
    <pre>
 
        Bubble Sort works on the simple principle of repeatedly comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:

        1. **Passes**: Bubble Sort begins by making a pass through the entire array, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are out of order. This process continues until no more swaps are needed during a pass.

        2. **Bubbling Up**: During each pass, the largest element in the unsorted portion "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end of the array. 

        3. **Repeat Until Sorted**: Bubble Sort keeps repeating the pass process, with each pass making the next largest element move to its proper place. The algorithm continues until no more swaps are required in a pass.

        4. **Final Result**: Once the algorithm completes without any swaps in a pass, the array is fully sorted from smallest to largest.

        While Bubble Sort is simple to understand and implement, it's not suitable for large datasets due to its average and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2). It is primarily used as an educational tool to introduce the concept of sorting algorithms.
