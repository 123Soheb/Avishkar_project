    <h1>Bucket Sort Algorithm</h1>

    <p>
      In this article, we will explore the Bucket Sort Algorithm. Bucket Sort is
      an efficient sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements
      into a number of buckets, each of which is then sorted individually,
      either using a different sorting algorithm or recursively applying Bucket
      Sort. Understanding Bucket Sort is valuable for solving problems where
      data falls into distinct ranges or intervals.

    <li>The data to be sorted is uniformly distributed over a range.</li>

    <h1>Algorithm</h1>
    <pre>
        The data to be sorted is uniformly distributed over a range.
        Stability is important in sorting.
        Algorithm
        Bucket Sort divides the input into a fixed number of buckets, then sorts each bucket individually, either using a different sorting algorithm or recursively applying Bucket Sort. Here's a high-level summary of the algorithm:

        1. **Create Buckets**: Create an array of empty buckets, with each bucket representing a specific range or interval.

        2. **Distribute Elements**: Distribute each element from the input array into the appropriate bucket based on its value. This step can be performed by determining the bucket index using a hashing function or simple arithmetic.

        3. **Sort Buckets**: Sort each bucket individually, either using another sorting algorithm (e.g., Insertion Sort, Quick Sort) or by recursively applying Bucket Sort.

        4. **Concatenate Buckets**: After sorting all the buckets, concatenate them to obtain the sorted array.

        begin BucketSort(arr, maxVal)  
           n = length of arr
           bucketSize = maxVal / n  // Determine the size of each bucket
           buckets = array of n empty buckets

           // Distribute elements into buckets
           for i from 0 to n-1
               index = arr[i] / bucketSize  // Calculate the bucket index
               buckets[index].append(arr[i])

           // Sort each bucket (using Insertion Sort for simplicity)
           for i from 0 to n-1
               InsertionSort(buckets[i])

           // Concatenate the sorted buckets to obtain the final sorted array
           result = []
           for i from 0 to n-1
               result.append(buckets[i])
           return result     
        end BucketSort

        // Helper function for sorting a bucket using Insertion Sort
        begin InsertionSort(bucket)  
           for i from 1 to length(bucket)-1
               key = bucket[i]
               j = i - 1
               while j >= 0 and bucket[j] > key
                   bucket[j + 1] = bucket[j]
                   j = j - 1
               end while
               bucket[j + 1] = key
           end for
        end InsertionSort
    </pre>
    <h1>Working of Bucket Sort Algorithm</h1>
    <pre>
 
        Bucket Sort is designed for scenarios where the data falls within specific ranges or intervals, such as grades, temperatures, or other continuous data. Here's a detailed explanation of how Bucket Sort works:

        1. **Bucket Creation**: The algorithm begins by creating an array of empty buckets. The number of buckets is determined based on the maximum value in the input array.

        2. **Distribute Elements**: Each element from the input array is placed into its respective bucket. This is done by calculating the bucket index using a hashing function or simple arithmetic based on the value of the element.

        3. **Sort Buckets**: Each bucket is sorted individually. This can be done using a variety of sorting algorithms, with Insertion Sort being a common choice due to its efficiency for small lists.

        4. **Concatenate Buckets**: Once all the buckets are sorted, they are concatenated to obtain the final sorted array. The order of concatenation is based on the order of the bucket indices.

        Bucket Sort's performance depends on the distribution of data. When data is uniformly distributed, it can perform exceptionally well. However, its performance may degrade if data is not well-distributed or if there are many empty buckets.

        Bucket Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements. It is a valuable tool for sorting continuous data within specified ranges efficiently.
