    <h1>Quick Sort Algorithm (Hoare's Partition)</h1>

    <p>
      In this article, we will explore the Quick Sort algorithm with Hoare's
      Partition scheme. Quick Sort is a highly efficient, divide-and-conquer
      sorting algorithm known for its speed and performance. Hoare's Partition
      is one of the popular partitioning schemes used in Quick Sort. It is a
      versatile algorithm that can be used for sorting arrays and lists of
      various sizes.

    <h1>Algorithm</h1>
    <pre>
        Efficiency and speed in sorting are crucial.
        Optimal space complexity is not a primary concern.
        Algorithm
        Quick Sort with Hoare's Partition is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that efficiently sorts elements by selecting a "pivot" element and partitioning the array or list into two subarrays â€“ elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot. The subarrays are then recursively sorted.

        Here's a high-level summary of the algorithm:

        1. **Choose a Pivot**: Select a pivot element from the array. The choice of pivot can significantly impact the algorithm's performance.

        2. **Partitioning**: Rearrange the elements in the array so that all elements less than the pivot come before all elements greater than or equal to the pivot. This process is called partitioning.

        3. **Recursive Sorting**: Recursively apply the Quick Sort algorithm to the subarrays created by the partitioning step.

        begin QuickSort(arr, low, high)  
           if low < high
               // Partition the array and get the pivot index
               pivotIndex = HoarePartition(arr, low, high)

               // Recursively sort the subarrays
               QuickSort(arr, low, pivotIndex)
               QuickSort(arr, pivotIndex + 1, high)
           end if
        end QuickSort

        begin HoarePartition(arr, low, high)  
           pivot = arr[low]
           i = low - 1
           j = high + 1

           loop
               repeat
                   i = i + 1
               until arr[i] >= pivot

               repeat
                   j = j - 1
               until arr[j] <= pivot

               if i >= j
                   return j
               end if

               swap arr[i] and arr[j]
           end loop
        end HoarePartition

    <h1>Working of Quick Sort (Hoare's Partition)</h1>
    <pre>
 
        Quick Sort with Hoare's Partition is an efficient sorting algorithm that employs a divide-and-conquer approach. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:

        1. **Choose a Pivot**: The algorithm starts by selecting a pivot element from the array. The choice of pivot can significantly impact the algorithm's performance.

        2. **Partitioning**: The array is rearranged so that all elements less than the pivot come before all elements greater than or equal to the pivot. This partitioning is achieved using two pointers, `i` and `j`, which move towards each other. `i` finds the first element greater than or equal to the pivot, and `j` finds the first element less than or equal to the pivot. When `i` and `j` cross each other, the partitioning is complete.

        3. **Recursive Sorting**: The subarrays created by the partitioning step are recursively sorted using the same Quick Sort algorithm. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

        Quick Sort with Hoare's Partition is known for its efficiency and is often used for sorting large datasets. However, it may not be the best choice for small arrays due to its recursive nature.
