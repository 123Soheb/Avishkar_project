    <h1>Heap Sort Algorithm</h1>

    <p>
      In this article, we will explore the Heap Sort Algorithm. Heap Sort is an
      efficient in-place sorting algorithm known for its consistent performance.
      Understanding Heap Sort is essential for anyone working with sorting
      algorithms.

        In-place sorting is required, i.e., sorting is done within the same array.
        A stable and efficient sorting algorithm is needed.
        Algorithm
        Heap Sort is based on a binary heap data structure. The algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:

        1. **Build a Max Heap**: First, build a max heap from the unsorted array. This involves rearranging the array's elements to satisfy the heap property, where the parent is greater than or equal to its children.

        2. **Extract Elements**: Repeatedly extract the maximum element (root) from the max heap and place it at the end of the array. This operation also reduces the heap size.

        3. **Heapify**: After extracting an element, ensure that the remaining elements in the heap maintain the heap property. This is done through a process called "heapify."

        4. **Repeat**: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the entire array is sorted.

        begin HeapSort(arr)  
           buildMaxHeap(arr)  // Build a max heap
           heapSize = length of arr
           for i from heapSize-1 down to 0
               swap(arr[0], arr[i])  // Move the maximum element to the end
               heapify(arr, i, 0)  // Heapify the remaining heap
           end for     
           return arr     
        end HeapSort

        begin buildMaxHeap(arr)  
           heapSize = length of arr
           for i from heapSize/2 - 1 down to 0
               heapify(arr, heapSize, i)
           end for
        end buildMaxHeap

        begin heapify(arr, heapSize, root)  
           largest = root
           left = 2 * root + 1
           right = 2 * root + 2

           if left < heapSize and arr[left] > arr[largest]
               largest = left
           if right < heapSize and arr[right] > arr[largest]
               largest = right

           if largest != root
               swap(arr[root], arr[largest])
               heapify(arr, heapSize, largest)
           end if
        end heapify
    </pre>
    <h1>Working of Heap Sort Algorithm</h1>
    <pre>
 
        Heap Sort works by transforming the unsorted array into a binary max heapâ€”a data structure where each parent node is greater than or equal to its children. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:

        1. **Build Max Heap**: The first step involves building a max heap from the unsorted array. This is done by rearranging the elements to satisfy the max heap property, where the parent node is greater than or equal to its children. Building the max heap ensures that the largest element (the root) is at the top.

        2. **Extraction and Heapify**: The largest element (the root of the max heap) is extracted and placed at the end of the array. This operation reduces the heap size. The remaining elements are then heapified to maintain the max heap property. This process continues, with the maximum element being moved to the end of the array in each iteration.

        3. **Repeat**: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the entire array is sorted. The sorted elements accumulate at the end of the array during each iteration.

        4. **Final Result**: Once all iterations are complete, the array is fully sorted in ascending order.

        Heap Sort's in-place nature makes it memory-efficient, and its consistent performance with a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst, average, and best cases makes it a reliable choice for sorting large datasets.
